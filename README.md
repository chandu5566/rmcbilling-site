## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chandu5566/rmcbilling-site.git
   cd rmcbilling-site
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash

   ```

3. **Configure API endpoint**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` and update `VITE_API_BASE_URL` with your backend API URL.

## API Configuration

All API endpoints are centralized in `src/config/api.js`. To update API details:

1. Open `src/config/api.js`
2. Update the `BASE_URL` or individual endpoint paths as needed
3. All modules will automatically use the updated configuration

### API Configuration Structure

```javascript
const API_CONFIG = {
  BASE_URL: 'http://your-api-url/api',
  ENDPOINTS: {
    SALES_INVOICE: { LIST, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, GET_BY_ID },
    DELIVERY_CHALLAN: { ... },
    CUSTOMER: { ... },
    // ... other endpoints
  },
  TIMEOUT: 30000,
  HEADERS: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
};
```
